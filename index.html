          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Poverty:</strong> There appears to be a slight positive correlation between poverty and all three of the factors
                looked at. States with a higher % of their population in poverty, also experience higher levels of obesity,
                smoking and lack of healthcare.
              </li>
                
              <li>
                <strong>Age:</strong> There appears to be a positive correlation between age and smoking. The older the
                population, the more likely they are to smoke. There is a negative correlation between age and healthcare.
                The older a population, the more likely they are to have healthcare. There does not appear to be a correlation between age and obesity. 
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Household Income:</strong> There appears to be a negative correlation between household income and obesity.
                The same can be said for smoking. The poorer the population, the more likely it is to be obese and smoke.
